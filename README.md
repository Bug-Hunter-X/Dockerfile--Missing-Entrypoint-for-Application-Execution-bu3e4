This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: the absence of an ENTRYPOINT instruction.  The provided Dockerfile attempts to run a Python application but lacks a defined entrypoint, resulting in a failure to execute the application. The solution showcases how to correctly define an entrypoint and ensure the application runs as expected within the Docker container.
